# Pewlett_Hackard_Employee_Data_Analysis

Project Overview
The Pewlett Hackard Employee Data Analysis Project explores and analyzes historical employee data from the 1980s and 1990s. This project encompasses data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis to gain insights into the company's past workforce.

Project Structure
The project comprises three primary phases:

1. Data Modeling
    * Inspection of CSV files.
    * Creation of an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to design the database schema using tools like QuickDBD.
    
2. Data Engineering
    * Creation of a table schema for each of the six CSV files, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
    * Importation of each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
    
3. Data Analysis
    * Execution of data analysis by answering specific questions about the employee data.
